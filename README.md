## What is the purpose of this repository ?
Created to save and share my Mentor Front-End challenges. My goal is to become a better frontend developer, for that, I will do all the challenges and tasks and evolve my code gradually.

## What's Front End Mentor ?
FrontEnd Mentor is a website that contains both frontend and backend development challenges. It's a good place to gain experience with more real projects, being able to compare your code and share it on LinkedIn.
